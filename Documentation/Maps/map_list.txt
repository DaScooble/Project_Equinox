	oppressive, mean, cold, cramped ticket gates
	inner platform
	broken escalator
	long mysterious phatom train platform
	dripping water from the ceiling that leads the player to tunnel

tunnel
	dark tunnel underground, mossy, and dank
	trickling water forms a tiny stream
	sewer grates on the roof of the tunnel that let in some soft light
	The tunnel is dark, and then leads out to the head of the gorge

gorge (outside)
	very narrow and tall gorge like columnbia river 
	pebbles and small rocks in the stream
	gorge eventually opens up and there are larger boulders
	stone boulder walkway along the creek

	mostly circular
	small island in the middle of the pond
	dense impassable forest around the pond area
	light rays through canopy
	path leading to the house in the woods over bridge

house in the woods
	exact same model as the interior of the home
	looks more lived-in and like a family
	like warm, loved, childhood, toys
